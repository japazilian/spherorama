For running:
  1. Go to source tab on this website
  1. Execute svn command to download source
  1. (if you haven't already) Install Eclipse and Android SDK
  1. Import project into eclipse

For running, modifying and committing:
  1. You will need permission to commit to this repository
    * Talk to Prof. Gustavo about adding you under "members"
  1. Install Eclipse and Android SDK
    * For easier access, I recommend installing an svn plugin known as subclipse that you can connect to the repository using the link in the Source tab.
      1. Checkout code using plugin
      1. Make changes as needed
      1. To commit, right click on project, ->Team->commit
    * I haven't tried this, but it is possible to use standard svn command line to checkout and commit code
      1. use command in Source tab to checkout
      1. Make changes as needed
      1. use svn commit to commit changes to repository
