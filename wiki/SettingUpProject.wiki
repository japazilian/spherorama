#summary How to set up the project for running/improvements

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page is for directions on how to download the source code for running or modifications. 


= Steps =

For running:
  # Go to source tab on this website
  # Execute svn command to download source
  # (if you haven't already) Install Eclipse and Android SDK
  # Import project into eclipse

For running, modifying and committing:
  # You will need permission to commit to this repository
    * Talk to Prof. Gustavo about adding you under "members"
  # Install Eclipse and Android SDK
    * For easier access, I recommend installing an svn plugin known as subclipse that you can connect to the repository using the link in the Source tab. 
      # Checkout code using plugin
      # Make changes as needed
      # To commit, right click on project, ->Team->commit
    * I haven't tried this, but it is possible to use standard svn command line to checkout and commit code
      # use command in Source tab to checkout
      # Make changes as needed
      # use svn commit to commit changes to repository
